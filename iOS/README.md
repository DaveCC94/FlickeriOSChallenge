Basic Flickr viewing app

Exercise:
=======

The view is made on MVVM. Which I tried to make it plaform agnostic.

Each Cell has its own controller. 

The `Composer` is the way I intended to init the views, so it has all the dependencies needed to work.

I had tons of work so I coudn't dedicate as much time as I had planned, so I couldn't finish as I wanted. My intention was to change the tableview to a collectionview, and provide a nicer view for the detail.

Another thing that I wanted to add is a button to try to reload the image in case of failure, and some message when the network connection failed. If I started the same day that I received the challenge I think I would've finish as I wanted. 

As far as the statements went, I'm delivering the aspects requested, but personally I would have love to finish as I originally intended.

Thanks for tha challenge it was very fun
